# rl_duckdb_data_layer.py (v1.5 â€” reward scaled by 1000x)
# - Timestamp: supports 'ts' or 'timestamp' (TIMESTAMP)
# - L1 fields: bid_px_1 / ask_px_1 / bid_sz_1 / ask_sz_1
# - Features: mid, spread, imbalance, mom1, mom3, vol3
# - Next-state (H bars ahead): mid_p, spread_p, imbalance_p, mom1_p, mom3_p, vol3_p
# - Reward: fwd_ret_raw = (mid_p - mid)/mid ; fwd_ret = 1000 * fwd_ret_raw
# - union_by_name=true to tolerate schema drift across days/files
